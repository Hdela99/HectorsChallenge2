# HectorsChallenge2
This will be the host branch of my portfolio. This will be updated as I continue to make a variety of websites, refactoring public code, 
creation of possible apps or basic scripts that can help in daily life. As of 06/23/2022 it is small as I only have been involved in the refactoring
of one website but it will continue to increase and eventually may have to have a more complicated navigation bar for types of projects based on either 
languages used, project type(read website/app), or on what side of development the project represents my professional development on.
